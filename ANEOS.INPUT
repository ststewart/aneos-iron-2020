*
*   Liquid model adjustment parameters
*   alpha, beta, gamma should be between 0 and 0.5. Beta and gamma cannot be equal.
*   C62 adjusts critical point = eta?
*
*   Note:  Lines must not be longer than 120 characters
*
*   Explanation of new input parameters for molecular clusters:
*
*   There are 8 new input parameters that appear on line ANEOS6 and ANEOS7 in the space
*   Sam Thompson originally alloted for extensions.  You must use the LONG 
*   input format to access this new data.
*
*   Atoms is the number of atoms in the molecular cluster.  If Atoms = 0 or 1
*          no molecular clusters are added.  The current code can treat both
*          Atoms = 2 (diatomic) or Atoms = 3 (triatomic) clusters.
*
*   Ebind is the binding energy of the molecules in eV.
*
*   RotDOF is the number of rotational degrees of freedom in the molecule.  It is 2 for.
*          a diatomic molecule.  Larger values increase the heat capacity of the molecular gas.
*
*   Rbond is the bond length of the clusters in cm.  This is needed to compute
*         the moment of inertia (hence rotational energy level spacing) of the molecules.
*
*   VibDOF is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom.  It is 1 for diatomic molecules,
*          but larger values apply to polyatomic molecules.
*
*  Theta_vib is the effective "debye" temperature of the molecule.  k * Theta_vib is the average
*          spacing of vibrational energy levels.
*
*   MieFlag = 0 uses the standard ANEOS cold pressure equation of state.
*           = 1 substitues a Mie-type cold potential for Pc when eta < 1.
*
*   a_exp is the exponent of the density in the Mie potential
*          for expanded states only. It has no effect on the compressed pressure.
*          use this parameter to move the critical point by changing the shape
*          of the cold expanded pressure.

*
*   Further information on the use of interpolation coefficients:
*
*     Adjustments to the critical point (Thompson and Lauson 1972, Appendix E)
*
* STSM C54 and C53 descriptions were switched?
*      C54 density limit to the adjustment of the cold pressure for
*          expanded states.  Set between (critical density)/Rho00 and
*          0.95.  C54 is a dimensionless ratio Eta = Rho/Rho00.
*
*      C53 presssure coefficient of cold pressure modification.  In units
*          of dyne/cm**2.  If increased too much it can produce a multiple
*          critical point, so be careful!  In general, this moves the critical point
*          up and down along the phase curve, and can change the critical ratio
*          but not the slope of the phase curve.
*
*      Adjustments to Gruneisen Gamma (and hence Debye temperature). See Thompson 1990. 
*
*      C60 is for density equal to or greater than Rho00.  Interpolates between 
*          two different functional forms for the Gruneisen Gamma's dependence
*          on density. C60 ranges from 0. to 1. (0. is the original function, 
*          1. is alternate, intermediate values give mixtures).
*
*      C61 is for density less than Rho00, C61 is simply added to gamma.  This can
*          make Gamma discontinuous at Rho00, so be careful!
*
*      Adustment to the transition between liquid and vapor limits (Thompson 1990)
*
*      C62  must be between 0. and 1., but cannot be exactly equal to 1.
